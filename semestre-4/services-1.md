# Services et Injection de dÃ©pendances

## Fetching Services&#x20;

Symfony comes packed with a lot of useful objects, called services. These are used for rendering templates, sending emails, querying the database and any other "work" you can think of.

If you need a service in a controller, type-hint an argument with its class (or interface) name. Symfony will automatically pass you the service you need:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11&#x20;

```php
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface 

//...

/**
* @Route("/lucky/number/{max}")
*/
public function number($max, LoggerInterface $logger)
{
 $logger->info('We are logging!');
 // ...
}
```

* Awesome!
